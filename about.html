<p>Welcome! I’m Antonio, a Full-Stack Software Developer with a Ruby on Rails focus. I believe that coding is a powerful tool for building things that improve peoples’ lives everyday.</p>

<p>In order to get the robust knowledge needed to bring project ideas to life, I decided to learn to code. In 2016, I enrolled in the Flatiron School’s Learn-Verified Online Web Developer Program, and I’ve been hooked on coding ever since.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading, cooking with my wife, and dreaming of world travels.</p>
