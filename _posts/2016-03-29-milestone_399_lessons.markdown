I decided to check my status today. As it turns out, I am 399 lessons into the Learn Verified (LV) program! In 8 weeks, I’ve gained an understanding of the front-end (HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap framework), object-oriented programming, SQL and object-relational mapping (ORM), and currently working with the Sinatra framework to create functional web apps that use complex forms, databases and obtain user input.

There is still so much to learn with LV and about the world of programming. It’s been an incredibly wonderful experience so far and I am excited to keep on moving forward. ***Next up: Sinatra final project and Rails!***
