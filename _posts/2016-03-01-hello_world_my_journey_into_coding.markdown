Hello World!
```

I was excited by coding from the moment I first returned "Hello World!" in the terminal.

It all started with the free lessons on [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) in late 2015.  At the time, I was working full-time as an attorney, but before and after work I would dive into the learning tracks.  From HTML & CSS to JavaScript to Ruby, I could not get enough and was excited!

I am drawn to coding because, with it, I can bring ideas to life, create interactive art, and improve peoples' lives everyday.  I can be a builder and bring ideas discussed with my wife and friends or dreamed at night into reality - I could build that e-commerce marketplace for sustainable goods or build that online community to guide kids with allergies.  I can be an artist, designing dynamic user experiences, that receive input, relay desired information, and grow with crowd-source data.  Most importantly, I can be a good person, creating solutions for problems big and small, whatever they may be.

In 2016, I enrolled in the Flatiron School's [Learn-Verified](https://learn.co) full-stack web development program to get the robust knowledge needed to become a professional developer, and I've been hooked on coding ever since!

Coding is incredible and I look forward to it everyday. Thanks for joining me on this journey.

//Dream, Design, Develop
