title:  Milestone - Riding Rails to 499 Lessons

I checked my status today and I've now gone through 499 lessons of the Learn Verified (LV) program!

After 12 weeks, I was able to create [SightSeeDC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXplBn7gSdI), a full-fledged web application.  SightSeeDC incorporated the knowledge I've gained on the front-end (HTML, CSS), object-oriented programming in Ruby, object-relational mapping in SQL, and working with frameworks like Sinatra and Bootstrap.

There is still so much to learn - in fact, I know the learning will never end in programming.  I am now riding the Ruby on Rails train and excited for the next step in the journey.  Next milestone: Rails final project!
