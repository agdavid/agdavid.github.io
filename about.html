<p>Welcome! I’m Antonio, a soon-to-be Full-Stack Software Developer with an expected Ruby on Rails focus. I believe that coding is a powerful tool for building things that improve peoples’ lives everyday.</p>

<p>In order to get the robust knowledge needed to bring project ideas to life, I decided to learn to code. In 2016, I enrolled in the Flatiron School’s Learn-Verified full-stack web development program, and I’ve been hooked on coding ever since.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading, cooking with my wife, and dreaming of world travels.</p>
